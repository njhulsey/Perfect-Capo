# Perfect-Capo
The electrical system of perfect-capo is capable of unclenching the clamp mechanism via capacitive touch. The board uses an ATtiny84 MCU for basic logic and control. It is capable of driving the speed and direction of a DC Motor via an H-bridge. The pins along the edge of the PCB are for external connections to be soldered on (such as Motor, Capacitive touch, Battery, Switch). The entire system is powered by a 3.7v LiPo Battery which is buck-boosted to 5v for better motor performance. A Micro-USB connector is present for programming and battery charging. The MCU uses a bootloader to simulate USB for simple hardware implementation. It is also able to charge the LiPo via the MCP73831 IC. Many additional pinouts are available for easy hackability and ease of use.
